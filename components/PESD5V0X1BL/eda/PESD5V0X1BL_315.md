## Circuit board layout and protection device placement

Circuit board layout is critical for the suppression of ESD, Electrical Fast Transient (EFT) and surge transients. The following guidelines are recommended:

1. Place the device as close to the input terminal or connector as possible.
2. Minimize the path length between the device and the protected line.
3. Keep parallel signal paths to a minimum.
4. Avoid running protected conductors in parallel with unprotected conductors.
5. Minimize all Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) conductive loops including power and ground loops.
6. Minimize the length of the transient return path to ground.
7. Avoid using shared transient return paths to a common ground point.
8. Use ground planes whenever possible. For multilayer PCBs, use ground vias.# 11. Package outline

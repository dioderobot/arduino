### 1.1.1 VCC

Digital supply voltage.

### 1.1.2 GND

Ground.

### 1.1.3 Port B (PB7:0) XTAL1/XTAL2/TOSC1/TOSC2

Port B is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port B output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port B pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port B pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.

Depending on the clock selection fuse settings, PB6 can be used as input to the inverting Oscillator amplifier and input to the internal clock operating circuit.

Depending on the clock selection fuse settings, PB7 can be used as output from the inverting Oscillator amplifier.
If the Internal Calibrated RC Oscillator is used as chip clock source, PB7... 6 is used as TOSC2... 1 input for the Asynchronous Timer/Counter2 if the AS2 bit in ASSR is set.

The various special features of Port B are elaborated in "Alternate Functions of Port B" on page 83 and "System Clock and Clock Options" on page 26.

### 1.1.4 Port C (PC5:0)

Port C is a 7-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The PC5... 0 output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port C pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port C pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.

### 1.1.5 PC6/RESET

If the RSTDISBL Fuse is programmed, PC6 is used as an I/O pin. Note that the electrical characteristics of PC6 differ from those of the other pins of Port C.

If the RSTDISBL Fuse is unprogrammed, PC6 is used as a Reset input. A low level on this pin for longer than the minimum pulse length will generate a Reset, even if the clock is not running. The minimum pulse length is given in Table 29-12 on page 310. Shorter pulses are not guaranteed to generate a Reset.

The various special features of Port C are elaborated in "Alternate Functions of Port C" on page 86.

### 1.1.6 Port D (PD7:0)

Port D is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port D output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port D pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port D pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.

The various special features of Port D are elaborated in "Alternate Functions of Port D" on page 89.

### 1.1.7 $\quad \mathrm{AV}_{\mathrm{CC}}$

$\mathrm{AV}_{\mathrm{CC}}$ is the supply voltage pin for the A/D Converter, PC3:0, and ADC7:6. It should be externally connected to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CC}}$, even if the ADC is not used. If the ADC is used, it should be connected to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CC}}$ through a low-pass filter. Note that PC6... 4 use digital supply voltage, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CC}}$.# 1.1.8 AREF 

AREF is the analog reference pin for the A/D Converter.

### 1.1.9 ADC7:6 (TQFP and QFN/MLF Package Only)

In the TQFP and QFN/MLF package, ADC7:6 serve as analog inputs to the A/D converter. These pins are powered from the analog supply and serve as 10-bit ADC channels.# 2. Overview 

The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.

### 2.1 Block Diagram

Figure 2-1. Block Diagram

The AVR core combines a rich instruction set with 32 general purpose working registers. All the 32 registers are directly connected to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), allowing two independent registers to be accessed in one single instruction executed in one clock cycle. The resulting architecture is more code efficient while achieving throughputs up to ten times faster than conventional CISC microcontrollers.The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P provides the following features: 4K/8Kbytes of In-System Programmable Flash with Read-While-Write capabilities, 256/512/512/1Kbytes EEPROM, 512/1K/1K/2Kbytes SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible Timer/Counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, a serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire Serial Interface, an SPI serial port, a 6-channel 10-bit ADC (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), a programmable Watchdog Timer with internal Oscillator, and five software selectable power saving modes. The Idle mode stops the CPU while allowing the SRAM, Timer/Counters, USART, 2-wire Serial Interface, SPI port, and interrupt system to continue functioning. The Power-down mode saves the register contents but freezes the Oscillator, disabling all other chip functions until the next interrupt or hardware reset. In Power-save mode, the asynchronous timer continues to run, allowing the user to maintain a timer base while the rest of the device is sleeping. The ADC Noise Reduction mode stops the CPU and all I/O modules except asynchronous timer and ADC, to minimize switching noise during ADC conversions. In Standby mode, the crystal/resonator Oscillator is running while the rest of the device is sleeping. This allows very fast start-up combined with low power consumption.

Atmel ${ }^{\circledR}$ offers the QTouch ${ }^{\circledR}$ library for embedding capacitive touch buttons, sliders and wheels functionality into AVR ${ }^{\circledR}$ microcontrollers. The patented charge-transfer signal acquisition offers robust sensing and includes fully debounced reporting of touch keys and includes Adjacent Key Suppression ${ }^{\circledR}\left(\mathrm{AKS}^{\text {TM }}\right)$ technology for unambiguous detection of key events. The easy-to-use QTouch Suite toolchain allows you to explore, develop and debug your own touch applications.

The device is manufactured using Atmel's high density non-volatile memory technology. The On-chip ISP Flash allows the program memory to be reprogrammed In-System through an SPI serial interface, by a conventional nonvolatile memory programmer, or by an On-chip Boot program running on the AVR core. The Boot program can use any interface to download the application program in the Application Flash memory. Software in the Boot Flash section will continue to run while the Application Flash section is updated, providing true Read-While-Write operation. By combining an 8-bit RISC CPU with In-System Self-Programmable Flash on a monolithic chip, the Atmel ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P is a powerful microcontroller that provides a highly flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded control applications.

The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P AVR is supported with a full suite of program and system development tools including: C Compilers, Macro Assemblers, Program Debugger/Simulators, In-Circuit Emulators, and Evaluation kits.

## 5. About Code Examples

This documentation contains simple code examples that briefly show how to use various parts of the device. These code examples assume that the part specific header file is included before compilation. Be aware that not all C compiler vendors include bit definitions in the header files and interrupt handling in C is compiler dependent. Please confirm with the C compiler documentation for more details.

For I/O Registers located in extended I/O map, "IN", "OUT", "SBIS", "SBIC", "CBI", and "SBI" instructions must be replaced with instructions that allow access to extended I/O. Typically "LDS" and "STS" combined with "SBRS", "SBRC", "SBR", and "CBR".

## 6. Capacitive Touch Sensing

The Atmel ${ }^{\circledR}$ QTouch ${ }^{\circledR}$ Library provides a simple to use solution to realize touch sensitive interfaces on most Atmel AVR ${ }^{\circledR}$ microcontrollers. The QTouch Library includes support for the Atmel QTouch and Atmel QMatrix ${ }^{\circledR}$ acquisition methods.

Touch sensing can be added to any application by linking the appropriate Atmel QTouch Library for the AVR Microcontroller. This is done by using a simple set of APIs to define the touch channels and sensors, and then calling the touch sensing API's to retrieve the channel information and determine the touch sensor states.

The QTouch Library is FREE and downloadable from the Atmel website at the following location: www.atmel.com/qtouchlibrary. For implementation details and other information, refer to the Atmel QTouch Library User Guide - also available for download from Atmel website.# 7. Register Summary

Note: 1. For compatibility with future devices, reserved bits should be written to zero if accessed. Reserved I/O memory addresses should never be written.
2. I/O Registers within the address range $0 \times 00-0 \times 1 F$ are directly bit-accessible using the SBI and CBI instructions. In these registers, the value of single bits can be checked by using the SBIS and SBIC instructions.
3. Some of the Status Flags are cleared by writing a logical one to them. Note that, unlike most other AVRs, the CBI and SBI instructions will only operate on the specified bit, and can therefore be used on registers containing such Status Flags. The CBI and SBI instructions work with registers $0 \times 00$ to $0 \times 1 F$ only.
4. When using the I/O specific commands IN and OUT, the I/O addresses $0 \times 00-0 \times 3 F$ must be used. When addressing I/O Registers as data space using LD and ST instructions, $0 \times 20$ must be added to these addresses. The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P is a complex microcontroller with more peripheral units than can be supported within the 64 location reserved in Opcode for the IN and OUT instructions. For the Extended I/O space from 0x60 - 0xFF in SRAM, only the ST/STS/STD and LD/LDS/LDD instructions can be used.
5. Only valid for ATmega88A/88PA/168A/168PA/328/328P.

### 10.1 Errata ATmega48A

The revision letter in this section refers to the revision of the ATmega48A device.

### 10.1.1 Rev. D

- Analog MUX can be turned off when setting ACME bit
- TWI Data setup time can be too short

1. Analog MUX can be turned off when setting ACME bit

If the ACME (Analog Comparator Multiplexer Enabled) bit in ADCSRB is set while MUX3 in ADMUX is '1' (ADMUX[3:0]=1xxx), all MUX'es are turned off until the ACME bit is cleared.

## Problem Fix/Workaround

Clear the MUX3 bit before setting the ACME bit.
2. TWI Data setup time can be too short

When running the device as a TWI slave with a system clock above 2 MHz , the data setup time for the first bit after ACK may in some cases be too short. This may cause a false start or stop condition on the TWI line.

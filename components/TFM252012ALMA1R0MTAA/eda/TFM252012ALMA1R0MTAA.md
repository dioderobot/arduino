# AEC-Q200 

## TFM252012ALMA type

## FEATURES

By using metal magnetic material with high Saturation magnetic flux density the excellent DC bias characteristics needed for inductors for power circuits can be achieved.
With the same product shape and terminal structure as general chip parts it has excellent mounting stability characteristics and can also be mounted to general-purpose land patterns.
By using a closed magnetic circuit structure leakage flux is minimized.
Compliant with AEC-Q200

## APPLICATION

ADAS ECU, in-Vehicle camera (view camera, sensing camera), radar, meter cluster, automotive communication module

* Rated current: smaller value of either Isat or Itemp.
Isat: When based on the inductance change rate ( $30 \%$ below the nominal value)
Itemp: When based on the temperature increase (temperature increase of $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by self heating)
Please contact us for the rated current vs. temperature characteristics (derating) at a product temperature of $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or higher.

Before using these products, be sure to request the delivery specifications.

## SAFETY REMINDERS

Please pay sufficient attention to the warnings for safe designing when using this products

## REMINDERS

The storage period is within 6 months. Be sure to follow the storage conditions (temperature: 5 to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, humidity: 20 to $75 \%$ RH or less).
If the storage period elapses, the soldering of the terminal electrodes may deteriorate.
Do not use or store in locations where there are conditions such as gas corrosion (salt, acid, alkali, etc.).
Before soldering, be sure to preheat components.
The preheating temperature should be set so that the temperature difference between the solder temperature and chip temperature does not exceed $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Soldering corrections after mounting should be within the range of the conditions determined in the specifications. If overheated, a short circuit, performance deterioration, or lifespan shortening may occur.
When embedding a printed circuit board where a chip is mounted to a set, be sure that residual stress is not given to the chip due to the overall distortion of the printed circuit board and partial distortion such as at screw tightening portions.
Self heating (temperature increase) occurs when the power is turned ON, so the tolerance should be sufficient for the set thermal design.
Carefully lay out the coil for the circuit board design of the non-magnetic shield type.
A malfunction may occur due to magnetic interference.
Use a wrist band to discharge static electricity in your body through the grounding wire.
Do not expose the products to magnets or magnetic fields.
Do not use for a purpose outside of the contents regulated in the delivery specifications.

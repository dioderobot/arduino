## PROTECTION PRODUCTS - RailClamp ${ }^{\circledR}$

## Description

RailClamp ${ }^{\circledR}$ TVS arrays are ultra low capacitance ESD protection devices designed to protect high speed data interfaces. This series has been specifically designed to protect sensitive components which are connected to high-speed data and transmission lines from overvoltage caused by ESD (electrostatic discharge), CDE (Cable Discharge Events), and EFT (electrical fast transients).
The RClamp ${ }^{\circledR} 0522$ PA and RClamp ${ }^{\circledR} 0524$ PA have a typical capacitance of only 0.30 pF between I/O pins. This allows it to be used on circuits operating in excess of 3 GHz without signal attenuation. They may be used to meet the ESD immunity requirements of IEC 61000-4-2. The RClamp0522PA is designed to protect two lines, while the RClamp0524PA will protect four lines. The RClamp0522PA is in a 6-pin SLP1610P4 package. It measures $1.6 \times 1.0$ with a nominal height of 0.58 mm . The RClamp0524PA is in a 10-pin SLP2510P8 package. It measures $2.5 \times 1.0$ with a nominal height of 0.58 mm . The leads are spaced at a pitch of 0.5 mm and are finished with lead-free NiPdAu. They are designed for easy PCB layout by allowing the traces to run straight through the device. The combination of small size, low capacitance, and high level of ESD protection makes them a flexible solution for applications such as HDMI, DisplayPort ${ }^{\mathrm{TM}}$, MDDI, and eSATA interfaces.

# Applications Information 

## Design Recommendations for HDMI Protection

Adding external ESD protection to HDMI ports can be challenging. First, ESD protection devices have an inherent junction capacitance. Furthermore, adding even a small amount of capacitance will cause the impedance of the differential pair to drop. Second, large packages and land pattern requirements cause discontinuities that adversely affect signal integrity. The RClamp0524PA and RClamp0522PA are specifically designed for protection of high-speed interfaces such as HDMI. They present $<0.4 \mathrm{pF}$ capacitance between the pairs while being rated to handle $> \pm 8 \mathrm{kV}$ ESD contact discharges ( $> \pm 15 \mathrm{kV}$ air discharge) as outlined in IEC 61000-4-2. Each device is in a leadless SLP package that is less than 1.1mm wide. They are designed such that the traces flow straight through the device. The narrow package and flow-through design reduces discontinuities and minimizes impact on signal integrity. This becomes even more critical as signal speeds increase.

## Pin Configuration

Figure 1 is an example of how to route the high speed differential traces through the RClamp0524PA. The solid line represents the PCB trace. The PCB traces are used to connect the pin pairs for each line (pin 1 to pin 10, pin 2 to pin 9, pin 4 to pin 7, pin 5 to pin 6). For example, line 1 enters at pin 1 and exits at Pin 10 and the PCB trace connects pin 1 and 10 together. This is true for lines connected at pins 2, 4, and 5 also. Ground is connected at pins 3 and 8. One large ground pad should be used in lieu of two separate pads. The same layout rules apply for the RClamp0522PA.

## TDR Measurements for HDMI

The combination of low capacitance, small package, and flow-through design means it is possible to use these devices to meet the HDMI impedance requirements of 100 Ohms $\pm 15 \%$ without any PCB board modification. Figure 3 shows a typical impedance test result for a TDR risetime of 200ps using a Semtech evaluation board with 100 Ohm traces throughout. Measurements were taken using a TDR method as outlined in the HDMI Compliance Test Specification (CTS). In each

## Applications Information

case, the device meets the HDMI CTS requirement of 100 Ohm $\pm 15 \%$ with plenty of margin.
Figure 3 shows a typical HDMI 1.3 eye pattern at 1080p resolution. As shown there are no violations of the eye pattern with RClamp0524PA in the circuit. The RClamp0524PA may also be used to protect the remaining lines (I2C, CEC, and hot plug). Figure 4 shows the complete protection solution.

## Layout Guidelines for Optimum ESD Protection

Good circuit board layout is critical not only for signal integrity, but also for effective suppression of ESD induced transients. For optimum ESD protection, the following guidelines are recommended:

- Place the device as close to the connector as possible. This practice restricts ESD coupling into adjacent traces and reduces parasitic inductance.
- The ESD transient return path to ground should be kept as short as possible. Whenever possible, use multiple micro vias connected directly from the device ground pad to the ground plane.
- Avoid running critical signals near board edges.


## Protecting MDDI Ports with RClamp0524P and RClamp0522P

The small package size and low capacitance of the RClamp0522PA and RClamp0524PA make them ideal for high-speed lines in portable applications. One such application is the protection of MDDI ports in cellular phones. MDDI is a serial data interface operating at $480 \mathrm{Mb} / \mathrm{s}$ per line pair. The lines are scalable for increased speed and display resolution. A MDDI port protection example is shown in Figure 5. The RClamp0524PA is used to protect two differential line pairs while an RClamp0522PA is used to protect the MDDI strobe lines. Note that devices are used on both the main board and LCD side of the MDDI port. Devices on the main board are needed to protect the MDDI controller in the Baseband processor and devices on the LCD board to protect MDDI controller in LCD module. A single line TVS such as the uClamp0501P is used to protect the MDDI power line. The protection devices should be placed close to the connector of each board. Traces are routed directly through each device, minimizing parasitic inductance. Connections to the ground plane should be made with multiple micro vias when possible.
